# E7RefreshShop

An automation tool for **Epic Seven** that refreshes the Secret Shop and automatically purchases valuable items.

## Description

E7RefreshShop automates the repetitive process of refreshing the Epic Seven Secret Shop. The program detects **Bookmarks** and **Mystic Medals**, purchases them when found, and continues refreshing until stopped.

This project was built both to solve a personal pain point and as a portfolio automation project.

## Features

- Automatically refreshes the Secret Shop
- Detects Bookmarks and Mystic Medals
- Purchases detected items
- Runs until Skystones are depleted or the **Esc** key is pressed

## Requirements

- LDPlayer emulator (only supported platform)
- Epic Seven must already be inside the Secret Shop before starting the program

## Notes

- Emulator-only support is intentional due to input and screen capture constraints
- Intended for learning and personal use
