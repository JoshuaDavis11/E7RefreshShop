# E7RefreshShop

This is a project that i decided to build as it solves an annoying repetivite task in a game i enjoy and also counts as a project for my portfolio.

This program will automatically refresh your epic seven secret shop and detect if bookmarks/mystic medals are inside and will purchase them and then repeat untill you run out of skytones or press the Esc key.

Please note: 
Currently this program only works on the emulator LDPlayer.
You need to start the program when already inside the secret shop.
This program currently cannot detect Mystic medals yet (hopefully i figure out how to fix that soon).
